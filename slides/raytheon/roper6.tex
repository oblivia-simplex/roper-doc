ROPER is now fully operational.

\vspace{.25cm}

It can solve two types of problems:
    \vspace{.3cm}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Given a register pattern, it can evolve a ROP-chain that achieves the specified register state. This is useful in preparing the registers for a system call, which is a typical goal for an exploit payload. In this capacity, ROPER is just automating human labour.
        \vspace{.3cm}
        \item However, it turns out that ROPER is capable of much more than this. It can generate chains that show signs of \emph{adaptive} behaviour. Even now, with very little tuning, it evolves chains that can solve traditional machine-learning classification problems.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{column}



\end{columns}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{6.1 Register Patterns}

ROPER can now be viewed as a compiler for a very basic, declarative scripting language. At the moment, this language consists of only one type of expression: a pattern consisting of 12 or fewer symbols, which can be either signed hexidecimal integer values, or wildcard characters. These tell ROPER what the CPU context should look like at the end of a chain's execution. 

\vspace{.25cm}

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
"1 _ 2 _ _ deadbeef"
\end{verbatim}

will instruct ROPER to evolve a ROP-chain that places
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 in register R0
    \item 2 in register R2
    \item 0xdeadbeef in register R5
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.2cm}

Finding such a chain typically only takes a few generations, since it's usually just a matter of popping values from the stack and moving them around as needed.

\vspace{.2cm}

This automates most of the work a human must do in building a ROP chain that makes a particular system call, the most common use case of ROP-chains.

    With ROPER's basic, pattern-matching functionality working, I wanted to see if, its genetic machinery could also be put to work on traditional machine-learning benchmarks. 
    
    \vspace{.25cm}
    
    One of the best-known such benchmarks is the classification of R.A. Fisher's Iris Data Set. The challenge is to predict the species of the iris on the basis of its measurements.
    
    \vspace{.25cm}
    
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{iris2.png}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{.5\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{iris.png}
    
    \small
    Remarkably, this worked, with just a minimal amount of tinkering with the engine that had so far only been used to evolve very simple, pattern-matching chains. It's far from efficient at this point, but ROPER has successfully evolved ROP-chains \emph{that can classify iris flowers with over 93\% accuracy}.
    
    \vspace{.25cm}
    
    This is, of course, only hints at the potential of adaptive payloads, that we can begin exploring with ROPER.
    
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{6.3 Maintaining Diversity}

One complication I faced was ensuring that ROPER's populations avoid getting trapped in local optima. This can happen whenever the diversity of the population flattens out.

\vspace{.5cm}

Two techniques were used to foster diversity, in this iteration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A few of the safety features in the initial gadget harvest were removed, allowing a much wider variety of gadgets into the gene pool. Many of these are highly error-prone, so fitness penalties were introduced to discourage error-throwing chains from reproducing.
    \item Every mating event now has a small probability of using an untested, purely random chain as one of the two parents. This provides a constant trickle of fresh blood into the gene pool.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{6.4 Novel Control Patterns}

%%% Try to condense some of this. It's rather verbose.

In an experiment aiming to broaden the gene pool, at the expense of increasing the error rate in the population, I removed a few of the filters I had placed in the gadget-harvesting functions, allowing chains to directly manipulate `special' registers (the instruction pointer, the stack pointer, etc.), perform branches, and push to the stack from which subsequent gadgets are popped. 

\vspace{.5cm}

This led to some extremely interesting and peculiar behaviour. Chains evolved that exploited strange and unexpected control patterns, deviating wildly from the expected pattern of repeatedly popping addresses from the stack into the PC.

\vspace{.5cm}

In two, very interesting cases, chains evolved that succeeded with dramatic detection rates (92\% and 98\%) against the iris.data dataset. In both cases, the chains edited their own address stack, exercising a surprising amount of control over their execution paths.
